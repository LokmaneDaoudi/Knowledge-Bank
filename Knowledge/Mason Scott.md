## Personality and Quirks

**A Disciplined Optimist:** [[Scott]] has always been know to achieve the impossible with very little resources due to his result-oriented approach especially in his darkest moments. His poverty, and the harsh which he went through in his childhood turned him into an extremely diligent person that swears to achieve the impossible.

**A prodigy**: [[Theodore Zakharov]], a renowned biotech professor, and a shareholder in [[Pioneergenics]], describes a [[Mason Scott]] as the best investment which he made in the scientific community. A genius with an innovative thinking, he's the type of person that looks at dead-angles which everyone seems to miss. According to him this is a second nature which he picked since his childhood.

**A Survivalist:** On top of his genius, [[Scott]] isn't crippled by an over-planning mindset, he's the kind of person who improvises in situations where he needs his survival instincts to kick in. A skill which was shaped in his childhood, and got sharpened during his service in the military in the Iraq war in 2003.

**Impulsive, reckless:** Where he's being put in situation where the other side in the conflict got everything to lose, he tends to act recklessly, and impulsively. This was illustrated into making the Time Machine, due to the fact that [[Theodore Zakharov]], his investor and mentor was always putting him as a second man taking all the fame and financial recognition. Which left Scott blinded by the idea of ascending to the top no matter what the cost.

**Quirks:** Scott is calm weary
