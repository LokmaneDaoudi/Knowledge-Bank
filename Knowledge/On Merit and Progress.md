**MOC**: [[Worldbuilding MOC]]

A [[political]] and [[ideological]] book written by [[Ezekiel Bauer]]. 

The text represents the rise of [[Promethism]] and ideology that on [[merit-based progress]].

### Content of the essay.
###### Criticism of Previous Ideologies

The first part of the book is an attempt by [[Bauer]] to criticize and derationalize all previous [[ideologies]] which he deemed, flawed, and was bound to prove it's failure, among his views about the previous ideologies are the following:

1.  [[Feudalism]]: He saw that this one was dominating in older times, due to the lack of technological advancement that was taking place, as many modern thinkers he criticised this ideology for its rigid hereditary hierarchies that stifle individual potential and enforce oppressive birthright privilege rather than achievement.

- [[Communism]]: [[Bauer's]] deemed communism as dreamy, idealistic  and naïve, failing to incentivise innovation and merit, leading to stagnation and bureaucratic repression.

1. [[Capitalism]]: Viewed as inherently exploitative and driven by profit maximization, which cultivates inequality due to human flaws such as greed, starvation for glory, etc.

2. [[Neocapitalism]]: Regarded as a superficial update to capitalism, perpetuating [[corporate dominance]] and market distortions without addressing systemic inequities.

- [[Liberalism]]: Seen as overly emotional, focused on abstract freedoms detached from material realities, failing to correct structural power imbalances or address technological disruption.

The part is regarded the biggest of the book which he tried to debunk every popular ideology that has been adopted by governments, and societies addressing real world case studies where these past [[ideologies]] failed to achieve its objectives
##### His views on What Led to [[The Blackfall]]

The second part of the book [[Bauer]] brights through his analytical lens addressing in full length a thorough examination on the consecutive events that led to the [[The Blackfall]], and [[collapse of societes]].

The highlights of his views are shown below:

**The Corruption of Ambition into Pride**:  Human ambition, once a driver of innovation, mutated into reckless hubris. Leaders and elites believed their technical prowess and political power made them invincible, ignoring warnings and escalating conflicts without restraint, mirroring Prometheus’s defiant but tragic overreach.

**The Corruption of Ambition into Pride**:  Politicians, shackled by the demands of wealth interests and electoral pressures, prioritised self-preservation and immediate gains over long-term stability. Their failure to regulate or responsibly control emerging technologies, including nuclear and cyber weapons, escalated risks dangerously.


**Failure of Collective Will and Moral Imagination:**

[[Bauer]] sees a catastrophic moral failure: humanity lacked the collective will to redefine its values and governance before catastrophe. Traditional ideologies and institutions were too rigid, fragmented, or self-interested to envision and enforce the kind of radical progress necessary to avert disaster.

**Banking System and Wealth Maximization:**

The author argues that the flawed global banking system, driven by insatiable profit maximization and debt cycles, corrupted political leadership worldwide. This relentless pursuit of wealth concentrated power in financial elites who manipulated governments toward policies exacerbating geopolitical tensions rather than resolving them.


###### [[The Common Good for Human Race]]

The third part of the book is the most controversial, where the author presents his own [[ideologies]] to achieve the [[ultimate solution]] that would not only cure the world from the after math of the [[The Blackfall]], but also prevent such calamities from happening. As this system removes the idea of a world centralized around divine entities such as religions, and won't also put the incompleteness of [[humanity]] in the center, but rather he states that humanity should push forward and risk allowing technology to lead the progression of human race to [[The Common Good for Human Race]]. 

His vision is shaped by a [[Promethean impulse]] that glorifies that humans love for progress, and their pursuit to technology wasn't just based on a lusty desire for ultimate comfort like [[Epicurus]] used to spread through his teachings, but [[Bauer]] arguments that [[humans]] unlike any other species there only way to reach progress is through claiming the tools, and powers to propel [[evolution]] through maximizing [[technological advancement.]] The only difference in his ideology is to frame technology as an actor, and not as a tool that can be used by corrupt individuals.

His core arguments can be summarised in the following points:

**Merit, Not a Birthright Nor Wealth**: Status and influence must be earned through demonstrable contributions to human enhancement and societal progress, not inherited or purchased.

**Progress as Imperative:** Technological and biological advancement are not luxuries, they are necessities to overcome existential threats. Only by constantly innovating can humanity stay ahead of catastrophe, resource scarcity, and political failures. 

**Redemption Through Suffering**: Like Prometheus, humanity must accept pain, loss, and sacrifice as necessary costs of transcending its primitive flaws. The story of Prometheus is a mandate for embracing risk and bearing the burdens of leadership and innovation.

**Liberation from Systemic Flaws:** Promethism is the antidote to the greed-driven policies, incompetent governance, and institutional stagnation that led to prior collapse. By separating advancement from selfish actors and concentrating power in the hands of the [[meritorious society]] can break free from historical cycles of failure.


**Collective Destiny:**

Promethism offers a new social contract, one that binds society together under the banner of progress, with clear rituals and values celebrating innovation, resilience, and ethical ambition, making every citizen responsible for pursuing and sustaining [[evolution]].


#### Lesson Learned: Last Part 

>Past [[ideologies]] have failed: some granted power by birth regardless of [[merit]], others enabled destruction or enforced false equality that erases true excellence, generating profound injustice.

> Now is the time to place [[progress]] as the sole guide. Technology must serve as th[[e definitive measure of merit]], empowering a more *[[capable humanity]]* to govern and work toward [[the common good for human race]]. 

>  Adoption of this ideology is not optional but existential; it is the sine qua non of a viable future
