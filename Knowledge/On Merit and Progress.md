A [[political]] and [[ideological]] book written by [[Ezekiel Bauer]]. 

The text represents the rise of [[Promethism]] and ideology that on [[merit-based progress]].

### Content of the essay.
###### Criticism of Previous Ideologies

The first part of the book is an attempt by [[Bauer]] to criticize and derationalize all previous [[ideologies]] which he deemed, flawed, and was bound to prove it's failure, among his views about the previous ideologies are the following:

1.  [[Feudalism]]: He saw that this one was dominating in older times, due to the lack of technological advancement that was taking place, as many modern thinkers he criticised this ideology for its rigid hereditary hierarchies that stifle individual potential and enforce oppressive birthright privilege rather than achievement.

- [[Communism]]: [[Bauer's]] deemed communism as dreamy, idealistic  and naïve, failing to incentivise innovation and merit, leading to stagnation and bureaucratic repression.

1. [[Capitalism]]: Viewed as inherently exploitative and driven by profit maximization, which cultivates inequality due to human flaws such as greed, starvation for glory, etc.

2. [[Neocapitalism]]: Regarded as a superficial update to capitalism, perpetuating [[corporate dominance]] and market distortions without addressing systemic inequities.

- [[Liberalism]]: Seen as overly emotional, focused on abstract freedoms detached from material realities, failing to correct structural power imbalances or address technological disruption.

The part is regarded the biggest of the book which he tried to debunk every popular ideology that has been adopted by governments, and societies addressing real world case studies where these past [[ideologies]] failed to achieve its objectives
###### [[The Common Good for Human Race]]

The second part of the book is the most controversial, where the author presents his own [[ideologies]] to achieve the [[ultimate solution]] that would not only cure the world from the after math of the [[The Blackfall]], but also prevent such calamities from happening. As this system removes the idea of a world centralized around divine entities such as religions, and won't also put the incompleteness of [[humanity]] in the center, but rather he states that humanity should push forward and risk allowing technology to lead the progression of human race to [[The Common Good for Human Race]]. 

His vision is shaped by a [[Promethean impulse]] that glorifies that humans love for progress, and their pursuit to technology wasn't just based on a lusty desire for ultimate comfort like [[Epicurus]] used to spread through his teachings, but [[Bauer]] arguments that [[humans]] unlike any other species there only way to reach progress is through claiming the tools, and powers to propel [[evolution]] through maximizing [[technological advancement.]] The only difference in his ideology is to frame technology as an actor, and not as a tool that can be used by corrupt individuals.

His core arguments can be summarised in the following points:
