## Personality and Quirks

**A Disciplined Optimist:** **[[Scott]]** has always been **known** to achieve the **impossible** with very little resources due to his **result-oriented approach**, especially in his **darkest moments**. His **poverty** and the **harshness** which he went through in his life turned him into an **extremely diligent person** who swears to achieve the **impossible**.

**A prodigy**: **[[Theodore Zakharov]]**, a renowned **biotech professor** and a **shareholder** in **[[Pioneergenics]]**, describes **[[Mason Scott]]** as the **best investment** he made in the scientific community. A **genius** with **innovative thinking**, he's the type of person that looks at **dead angles** which everyone seems to miss. This is a **second nature** which he picked up since his childhood.

**A Survivalist:** On top of his ***genius***, **[[Scott]]** isn't crippled by an ***over-planning mindset***; he's the kind of person who **improvises** in situations where he needs his **survival instincts** to kick in. This is a skill which was **shaped in his childhood** and got **sharpened** during his service in the **military** in the **Iraq War in 2003**.

**Impulsive, reckless:** In situations where the other side in the conflict has **everything to lose**, he tends to act **recklessly** and **impulsively**. This was illustrated in the creation of the **[[Time Machine]]**, due to the fact that **[[Theodore Zakharov]]**, his investor and mentor, was always treating him as a **second man**, taking all the **fame** and **financial recognition**. This left **Scott** blinded by the idea of ascending to the top **no matter what the cost**.

**Quirks as Keywords:** Calm, military-trained, sassy, provocative

## ## Character Evolution

**The Beginning**: Introduced as a **chased man** running against **time** to execute his plan, he gets to **[[Weston]]**, scoring a deal with him to sponsor his new invention, the **time machine**, before **[[Zakharov]]** and his **[[Theratorn]] squad** catch up to him. Unfortunately, though his plan was carefully **calculated**, **[[Weston]]** betrays him and puts him in **[[Theodore]]'s** grasp.

**Hero at the Zero Point:** The events that come after the **betrayal**, the **[[ATALA]] rescue mission**, and the **rollercoaster of further extreme events** that he encounters in **Russia** turn him into someone who has **nothing to lose**, letting his **recklessness** and **bad temper** resurface. This makes him take **brilliant, high-risk, high-reward decisions and actions**.

**Moral Complexity**: Throughout the story, the reader discovers that he's not following **a hero's journey** but rather **a flawed character** shaped by severe cases of **manipulation** throughout his life, which led **humanity** to a **dystopian, Promethean future** defined by the **two most dangerous invasions** which he was directly involved in creating. Knowing the **gravity of his actions**, he still kept going with it.

**The Complete Arc**: 
[[Mason Scott ]] begins as a [[parody]] of the American Dream, a manipulated opportunist whose greed and scientific ambition birth a global catastrophe. But when he realizes the "monster" he fights is actually a reflection of himself, his world shatters. Transforming from a glory-chaser into a reckless savior with nothing to lose, Scott sets out to destroy his own legacy, desperate to reverse the [[damage]] and restore the world to what it once was.
